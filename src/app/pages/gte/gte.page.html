          <p>GrowRuck 01 started in Jacksonville, FL on November 18th, 2016 at GORUCK headquarters, intertwining the roots of F3 GrowRuck and GORUCK. The first four GrowRucks were operated by F3Nation as part of the expansion efforts to target new AOs ready for growth.</p>
          <p>Starting with GrowRuck 05 in Chattanooga, The Iron Project (TIP) took over the GrowRuck operations in order to expand the GrowRuck program to FiA and other outside organizations. GrowRuck 12 in Memphis marked a renewed focus for GrowRuck to focus only on F3 and our foundational roots to expand and create growth in F3.</p>
